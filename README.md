## Introduction
Hi! This is my first Git repository, and it contains solutions to all the exercises from book: **Tony Gaddis "Starting Out With Python"**.

All exercises are organized by chapters and sections of the book.  
The solutions are written with a focus on simplicity and alignment with the book's material.

Project goals:
